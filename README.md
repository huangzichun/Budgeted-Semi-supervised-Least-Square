# Budgeted-Semi-supervised-Least-Square
> A novel semi-supervised least square algorithm for off-line and on-line classification task

## Semi-supervised Least Square
We derive a close-formed transductive and inductive solutions. The former is formally equivalent to the regularized harmonic solution of the label propagation on kernel matrix, while the latter ensures us to do the online update.

## Budgeted Semi-supervised Least Square
We turn to budgeted kernel learning and proposed a budgeted semi-supervised least square for online classification task.

## Details: TODO
